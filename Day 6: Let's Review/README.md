# Improvements in File Versions

There are three versions of the code represented in different files: `main.cpp`, `main2.cpp`, and `main3.cpp`.

## main.cpp

This file represents the initial attempt. It was the very first approach to solving the problem. The decision to use vectors over strings was primarily influenced by the default import of the `vector` library. While this code utilized vectors instead of strings, it was not optimized, containing more lines than necessary.

## main2.cpp

The second version, `main2.cpp`, was the first attempt at improving the code. The goal was to reduce unnecessary code and simplify the process. This version still relied on vectors but aimed to reduce redundancy and streamline the solution.

## main3.cpp

The final version, `main3.cpp`, was another attempt at "improving" the code. Despite its label as an improvement, the main objective in this version was to transition from using vectors to working with strings. It attempted to implement the improved concepts from `main2.cpp` while using string data structures.

The iterative versions showcase the process of refining the initial solution, gradually moving from vectors to strings, all while maintaining the improved concepts and code quality learned throughout the iterations.
