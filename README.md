# HackerRank-30-Days-of-Code
My solutions to the daily challenges for HackerRank's 30 Days of Code challenge.

My goal is always to complete the challenge first and then attempt to optimize/simplify. In instances where I submit multiple solutions, I will upload all submissions here. Main.cpp will always be my first submission and any subsequent mainX.cpp will be submissions containing optimizations/simplifications.
