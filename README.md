# 30 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my GitHub repository for Hackerrank's 30 Days of Code Challenge!

## About This Repository

As someone with a background in computer science (recent graduate with an Honors B.S. degree in computer science) and daily work involving code as a Firmware QA Engineer, you might wonder why I'm taking on a challenge designed for beginners. Here's the motivation behind my participation:

1. **Continuous Learning:** Coding, like any skill, benefits from regular practice. By working through these daily coding challenges, I aim to reinforce my understanding of fundamental concepts and maintain a strong foundation.

2. **Daily C++ Practice:** I don't write in C++ in my current role but I am required to read DLL source code written in C++ often. I'm actively following a course to (re)learn C++ to both help with my current role and aid in my journey to becoming a video game developer. This challenge provides an excellent opportunity for me to ensure daily practice and keep my C++ skills sharp.

3. **Enjoyable Brain Exercise:** Coding is not just a job; it's a passion. These challenges serve as a daily exercise for my brain, allowing me to tackle fun and engaging problems, even if they don't pose a significant difficulty for me.

## Coding Approach

My goal is always to complete the challenge first and then attempt to optimize/simplify. In instances where I submit multiple solutions, I will upload all submissions here. `main.cpp` will always be my first submission, and any subsequent `mainX.cpp` files will contain optimized or simplified solutions. At the top of any `mainX.cpp` files I will always strive to include a block comment showcasing exactly what changes were made and potentially why those changes were made.

### Daily Uploads

Please note that my submissions will (hopefully) be uploaded daily, corresponding to the unlocking schedule of the challenges. The challenges are locked until their given day at 9 AM, and I will promptly upload my solutions as they become available and I complete them. I will always strive to have the challenge completed the day it is released but sometimes I may not upload the solution the same day though I will be striving to do so.
