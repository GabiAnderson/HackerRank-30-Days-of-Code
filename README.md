# 30 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my GitHub repository for Hackerrank's 30 Days of Code Challenge!

## About This Repository

As someone with a background in computer science and daily work involving code as a Firmware QA Engineer, you might wonder why I'm taking on a challenge designed for beginners. Here's the motivation behind my participation:

1. **Continuous Learning:** Coding, like any skill, benefits from regular practice. By working through these daily coding challenges, I aim to reinforce my understanding of fundamental concepts and maintain a strong foundation.

2. **Daily C++ Practice:** As a professional in the field, I primarily work with C++. While these challenges may not be overly complex for my skill level, they provide an excellent opportunity to keep my C++ skills sharp and explore creative solutions.

3. **Enjoyable Brain Exercise:** Coding is not just a job; it's a passion. These challenges serve as a daily exercise for my brain, allowing me to tackle fun and engaging problems, even if they don't pose a significant difficulty for me.

## Coding Approach

My goal is always to complete the challenge first and then attempt to optimize/simplify. In instances where I submit multiple solutions, I will upload all submissions here. `Main.cpp` will always be my first submission, and any subsequent `mainX.cpp` files will contain optimized or simplified solutions.

### Daily Uploads

Please note that my submissions will be uploaded daily, corresponding to the unlocking schedule of the challenges. The challenges are locked until their given day (e.g., the next challenge, day 2, unlocks in 17 hours), and I will promptly upload my solutions as they become available.
